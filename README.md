Greetings!

My name is Nicol√°s Castellanos, and I am from Colombia.
I am a System's Engineering student, currently at Colombia's National University (UNAL), pursuing the dream of being a musician, but firstly securing economical backup from my second passion, science and technology.
I don't enjoy Web Development that much, but it's the biggest laboral offer. I like more things related to low level, like operating systems, compilers, data bases, etc...
